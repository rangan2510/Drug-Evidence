\begin{abstract}
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for biomedicine frequently produce plausible but unverifiable mechanistic claims, undermining their utility for safety-critical applications such as adverse event prediction, drug repurposing, and clinical decision support. The core pathology is \emph{generation-before-verification}: systems that permit language models to propose mechanistic links without requiring explicit, structured evidence paths. We address this by inverting the pipeline: \emph{structural traceability precedes and constrains generation}. Our deterministic Graph-RAG method validates drug--disease associations if and only if an explicit mechanistic path exists: Drug ($D$) to Target ($T$) to Phenotype ($P$), where edges are constructed from curated interaction databases (ChEMBL, OpenTargets) and validated via MedCPT-encoded retrieval over PubMed. We introduce a hybrid weighted scoring mechanism where the LLM acts as a ``negation detector'' to penalize factually incorrect high-similarity vectors below an acceptance threshold. We evaluate against the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)~\cite{davis2021ctd} on 50 rare and infrequently prescribed drugs spanning oncology, psychiatry, and cardiology, measuring retrieval quality (Precision@K, Recall@K) and generation faithfulness via a defined claim-extraction protocol. Every emitted association carries an audit-ready provenance trace: concrete protein targets, stable database identifiers, and verifiable literature support.

\section{Introduction}
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for grounding large language models in external knowledge, yet standard implementations suffer from a fundamental architectural flaw: they permit generation \emph{before} verifying that the retrieved evidence supports the claim~\cite{edge2024graphrag}. In safety-critical biomedical applications—adverse event prediction, drug repurposing, pharmacovigilance signal detection—this deficiency is untenable. A system that produces fluent mechanistic narratives (e.g., ``Drug X inhibits Protein Y, causing phenotype Z'') without explicit, verifiable evidence paths cannot be audited, reproduced, or trusted in regulatory contexts. Furthermore, current LLM-based systems may hallucinate literature citations, conflate correlation with causation, or synthesize plausible but fictitious mechanisms~\cite{wu2025medgraphrag}.

The problem is structural, not merely an engineering refinement. Standard RAG retrieves candidate passages via vector similarity and delegates link validation to the LLM, which operates as a black box over unstructured text. This design affords the model excessive discretion: it can assert mechanistic relationships even when the retrieved evidence is ambiguous, contradictory, or absent. For drug--disease associations, where outputs may inform clinical trials, drug safety labeling, or precision medicine strategies, such opacity is unacceptable.

\subsection{The Semantic Similarity Trap}
A specific vulnerability in vector-based retrieval is the \emph{Semantic Similarity Trap}. A user querying ``Does Drug X treat Disease Y?'' might retrieve a document stating ``Drug X does \emph{not} treat Disease Y'' because the sentence is semantically identical in topic, differing only by a negation. Pure vector retrieval scores this highly. If the LLM is not explicitly grounded, it may hallucinate a positive link based on the high retrieval score.

\subsection{Our Approach: Traceability Before Generation}
We invert the pipeline by enforcing \emph{deterministic structural constraints before generation}. A drug--disease association is accepted if and only if the system can construct an explicit mechanistic path of the form Drug~($D$)~$\to$~Target~($T$)~$\to$~Phenotype~($P$), where each edge is grounded in structured databases (ChEMBL for $D\to T$ interactions, OpenTargets for $T\to P$ associations) and validated via literature co-occurrence in PubMed/Europe~PMC. The LLM operates strictly as a \emph{reader} constrained to retrieved evidence; it summarizes but does not create, validate, or decide on link existence.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \emph{deterministic evidence-graph construction procedure} that constrains outputs to traceable $D\to T\to P$ paths.
    \item A \emph{hybrid weighted scoring scheme} ($0.8 \cdot \text{Vector} + 0.2 \cdot \text{LLM}$) that leverages the LLM as a context-aware summarizer while relying on vectors for recall, significantly reducing hallucinations.
    \item An \emph{evaluation protocol} against CTD~\cite{davis2021ctd} measuring retrieval quality (Precision@K, Recall@K) and hallucination rate.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
We situate our work at the intersection of three research threads: graph-augmented retrieval systems, explainable drug discovery, and agentic biomedical reasoning. Our contribution differs from prior work in enforcing \emph{deterministic, pre-generation constraints} rather than post-hoc verification or guidance.

\paragraph{Graph-RAG Systems.}
Early RAG systems relied on dense vector retrieval over unstructured corpora, which can produce hallucinated references when retrieval precision is low~\cite{wu2025medgraphrag}. Recent work like \textit{MedGraphRAG}~\cite{wu2025medgraphrag} employs hierarchical graph construction to anchor generation in clinical entities. However, it constructs graphs \emph{post-retrieval}, inheriting errors from upstream extraction. \textit{BTE-RAG}~\cite{joy2025bterag} retrieves mechanistic triples via curated APIs, improving provenance but lacking explicit ranking of multi-hop paths. Microsoft's \textit{GraphRAG}~\cite{edge2024graphrag} uses community detection for summarization but does not enforce biomedical path constraints. In contrast, our method enforces a \emph{rigid} $D\to T\to P$ schema \emph{before} generation.

\paragraph{Explainable Drug Discovery.}
Knowledge graphs are central to interpretable drug--disease modeling~\cite{zhong2025kagmlsurvey,zeng2022kg}. Benchmarks like PharmKG~\cite{zheng2021pharmkg} and generators like KGen~\cite{rossanez2020kgen} establish standards for constructing biomedical KGs from heterogeneous sources and literature. \textit{DrugReX}~\cite{huang2025drugrex} guides LLMs through biological paths but permits the model to select paths, introducing discretion. Deep learning approaches such as Stokes et al.~\cite{stokes2020deep} leverage graph neural networks over molecular structures to predict antibacterial activity, achieving strong empirical performance but sacrificing interpretability: predictions are latent embeddings without explicit mechanistic justification. Our work prioritizes interpretability by mandating explicit, database-backed paths.

\paragraph{Agentic Biomedical Reasoning.}
Agentic frameworks like \textit{RareAgent}~\cite{qin2025rareagent} use adversarial debates among agents to construct evidence graphs dynamically. While this increases coverage via exploratory search, it lacks deterministic acceptance rules, allowing agents to propose paths based on speculative evidence. Our approach complements this by defining strictly \emph{when} a path is valid (explicit thresholds) and restricting the LLM to summarization only.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
We replace the standard ``Web Search $\to$ LLM decides'' flow with a ``Deterministic Graph $\to$ LLM Summarizes'' flow.

\subsection{Problem Definition}
We define a valid \textbf{Association} strictly as a path where a Drug ($D$) binds to a Target ($T$) which is mechanistically linked to a Phenotype/Disease ($P$).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input:} Unique Chemical Entity (ChEMBL ID).
    \item \textbf{Output:} Ranked list of Phenotypes (EFO IDs).
    \item \textbf{Exclusions:} Purely statistical correlations without target evidence are excluded.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Deterministic Pipeline}
The system architecture operates in four distinct phases, illustrated in~\ref{fig:pipeline}. We describe each phase, including threshold selection rationale, edge case handling, and computational complexity.

\label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Deterministic Entity Resolution.}
To ensure reproducibility and robustness against nomenclatural variations, we employ a multi-tiered entity resolution strategy. Initially, the system queries a local lookup table pre-compiled from ChEMBL synonyms. If this direct mapping fails (e.g., due to misspelling, novel trade names, or colloquialisms), the system triggers a targeted Tavily web search to discover the corresponding ChEMBL ID. Upon retrieving a candidate identifier, we validate it against the official ChEMBL API, which serves as the authoritative source for confirming the ID and harvesting canonical synonyms. This hybrid approach leverages the flexibility of web search for discovery while ensuring that all final graph entities are rigorously anchored to a stable, versioned ChEMBL release.

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Evidence Graph Construction (Provenance).}
We construct the mechanistic evidence graph via three steps, each with explicit acceptance thresholds and error-handling logic:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Step A (Joint Retrieval $D \to \{T, P\}$):} We query the OpenTargets API to retrieve the drug's mechanism of action, simultaneously extracting both the functional protein targets~($T$) and the associated disease indications~($P$). This ensures that every target is contextualized by its relevant disease phenotype. To manage computational complexity for promiscuous drugs (e.g., kinase inhibitors), we rank targets by affinity and retain the top 20. Phenotype identifiers are normalized to EFO (Experimental Factor Ontology) for consistent matching.
    
    \item \textbf{Step B (Literature Validation):} For each candidate path~$(D, T, P)$, we query EuroPMC/PubMed to retrieve PubMed article IDs mentioning relevant entities. We prioritize abstracts over full-text for three reasons: (i)~abstracts are freely accessible, avoiding paywall-induced retrieval bias; (ii)~abstracts contain dense factual claims with high signal-to-noise ratio; (iii)~abstract retrieval via API is computationally cheaper and more reliable than full-text PDF parsing. We search for co-occurrences of entity names (drug, target gene symbol, disease) using Boolean queries.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Phase 3: Semantic Chunking and Encoding.}
Before vector storage, valid articles undergo \emph{Semantic Chunking}. Simply feeding entire abstracts to the LLM can lead to context window saturation and attention dilution. We segment text into coherent semantic blocks (e.g., 3-5 sentences), ensuring no sentence spans multiple chunks. To maintain contextual continuity, we enforce a token overlap (e.g., 50 tokens) between adjacent chunks. Each chunk is explicitly tagged with its source PMID to ensure downstream traceability. These chunks are then encoded using MedCPT and stored in Qdrant. This granular approach significantly reduces computational costs by retrieving only the specific evidence segments relevant to the mechanism, rather than processing entire documents.

\subsubsection{Phase 4: Hybrid Weighted Scoring.}
\label{sec:scoring}
Once candidate chunks are retrieved, we must score them. Standard RAG relies on the LLM to decide relevance, or purely on vector scores. However, in biomedicine, nuance is critical. We employ a hybrid weighted approach to balance high-recall semantic matching with high-precision factual verification.

\textbf{The Need for Weighted Scoring.} Pure vector retrieval ($S_{vec}$) is prone to the ``Semantic Similarity Trap'' where negations (e.g., "Drug X does NOT cause Y") score highly due to keyword overlap. Conversely, relying solely on an LLM ($S_{conf}$) for scoring is computationally expensive and can be swayed by the model's internal parametric bias. By using a weighted formula, we utilize the LLM specifically as a "gatekeeper" or "negation detector" for the high-scoring vector candidates, rather than as the primary search engine.

\textbf{The Scoring Formula.} For a given drug-disease hypothesis, the final score is:
\begin{equation}
    S_{final} = (w_{ret} \cdot S_{vec}) + (w_{llm} \cdot S_{conf})
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S_{vec}$: Cosine similarity score from MedCPT vector retrieval (Qdrant).
    \item $S_{conf}$: A normalized confidence score ($0-1$) from the LLM, indicating factual consistency of the retrieved evidence with the queried drug–disease hypothesis.
    \item Weights: $w_{ret} = 0.8$, $w_{llm} = 0.2$.
    \item \textbf{Threshold:} We implement a strict acceptance threshold of $\mathbf{0.52}$. Any association with $S_{final} < 0.52$ is rejected.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mechanism of Hallucination Reduction.} 
As visualized in \ref{fig:scoring_logic}, if the text says ``Drug X does \textbf{not} treat Y'', the vector score $S_{vec}$ might still be moderately high due to topic relevance (e.g., $0.6$). However, the LLM will assign $S_{conf} = 0$. The weighted sum drags the final score down to $0.48$ ($0.8(0.6) + 0.2(0)$), which falls below the $0.52$ threshold, resulting in rejection. Conversely, a confirmed positive association with the same vector score ($0.6$) but validated by the LLM ($S_{conf}=1.0$) yields a score of $0.68$, passing the threshold. This ensures that verifiable evidence rises to the top while negated or irrelevant matches are deterministically filtered.

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reference Dataset (Ground Truth):} We use the \textbf{Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)} as our gold standard. CTD provides manually curated chemical-disease interactions verified by experts from peer-reviewed literature.
    \item \textbf{Drug Selection Strategy:} We specifically selected a test set of 50 \textbf{rare and infrequently prescribed therapeutic drugs} (e.g., orphan drugs, specialized oncology agents). These drugs often inhabit the "long tail" of biomedical data distributions, where LLM training data is sparse. This selection critically evaluates the system's ability to retrieve specific, verifiable mechanistic details rather than relying on the statistical probability of common associations (e.g., Aspirin-Pain) often present in LLM pre-training corpora.
    \item \textbf{Automated Evaluation Protocol:} To ensure scalable and rigorous assessment without human intervention, we employ a medical semantic model (BioBERT-based encoder) to compute the cosine similarity between predicted phenotypes and ground truth labels.
    
    \item \textbf{Medical Semantic Similarity:} Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the set of predicted phenotypes and $\mathcal{G}$ be the set of ground truth phenotypes. We define a binary matching indicator $H_i$ for each prediction $p_i \in \mathcal{P}$ that equals 1 if it semantically matches any ground truth term with a cosine similarity threshold $\tau = 0.95$:
    \begin{equation}
        H_i = \mathbb{I}\left( \max_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \text{Sim}(p_i, g) > \tau \right)
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Precision and Recall matching:} We adopt standard definitions adapted for semantic matching. Precision@K ($P@K$) measures the proportion of valid matches in the top $K$ predictions. Recall@K ($R@K$) measures the proportion of ground truth terms covered by the top $K$ predictions.
    \begin{equation}
        P@K = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^{K} H_i
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
        R@K = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{G}|} \sum_{j=1}^{|\mathcal{G}|} \mathbb{I}\left( \max_{p \in \mathcal{P}_K} \text{Sim}(p, g_j) > \tau \right)
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Hallucination Rate Calculation:} We define the hallucination rate specifically as the proportion of top-10 generated phenotypes that fail to match any valid ground truth entry. This metric quantifies the rate of high-confidence false positives. Unlike Precision and Recall, lower values indicate better performance.
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Hallucination Rate} = 1 - P@10
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identifier Normalization and Leakage Control}
\textbf{Identifier Normalization.} 
Unlike stochastic text matching, our pipeline relies on strict ID resolution. All input drug names are deterministically mapped to ChEMBL IDs (e.g., ``Tylenol'' $\to$ CHEMBL112), and all phenotype predictions are mapped to EFO or MeSH identifiers. For evaluation against CTD, we map our predicted EFO IDs to the MeSH vocabulary used by CTD. This strict normalization prevents "hallucinated entities"—where an LLM might invent a plausible-sounding but non-existent drug name or disease variant.

\textbf{Leakage Control.} 
A critical risk in RAG evaluation is data leakage, where the test set (CTD) implicitly informs the retrieval source. To prevent this, we strictly sequester the CTD dataset; it is used \emph{only} as a test oracle. Our graph construction relies exclusively on ChEMBL and OpenTargets. This separation ensures that the "ground truth" links in CTD do not influence the retrieval pathway, providing a fair assessment of the system's ability to rediscover known associations from independent data sources.

\subsection{Comparative Methods}
We evaluate our deterministic approach against a state-of-the-art parametric baseline to demonstrate the trade-off between coverage and auditability.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baseline (GPT-4o Zero-shot):} We query GPT-4o (as of January 2026) with the prompt: \emph{"List the top 10 diseases treated by [Drug Name]."} We restrict the comparison to the top 10 outputs to ensure a focused evaluation of high-confidence predictions. This represents the current standard for "black-box" biomedical question answering.
    \item \textbf{Proposed Method (Deterministic Graph-RAG):} Our pipeline using MedCPT encoders, Llama-3.3-70b verifier, and the hybrid weighted scoring ($0.8/0.2$) described in \ref{sec:scoring}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Evaluation}
The results in \ref{tab:performance} and the ROC analysis in \ref{fig:auroc} highlight a critical trade-off suitable for scientific discovery.

\noindent\textbf{Analysis.} Our Graph-RAG method achieves significantly higher Precision@1 (0.800) and Precision@10 (0.352) compared to the baseline (0.640 and 0.234 respectively). The R@1 metric (0.047) further confirms that our method is more effective at correctly identifying the primary therapeutic indication for rare drugs than the baseline (0.036). The deterministic constraints act as a high-pass filter, ensuring that the highest-ranked results are mechanistically sound.

\textbf{Critical Drug Identification.}
Our deterministic approach demonstrated superior sensitivity for drugs where the baseline failed completely. For \textbf{Ethosuximide}, our pipeline mapped the drug to calcium channel targets (CACNA1G, CACNA1H) to retrieve validated links for childhood absence epilepsy, whereas the baseline treated it as a generic anti-convulsant. Similarly, for \textbf{Flecainide}, we correctly identified the SCN5A mechanism driving atrial fibrillation. In the case of \textbf{Benserazide}, often overshadowed in training data by its combination partner Levodopa, our system leveraged the ChEMBL-DDC target link to recover specific Parkinson's disease evidence, a relationship the baseline missed entirely.

\textbf{Provenance and Authenticity.}
A defining feature of our system is the provision of authentic provenance. For every association, our pipeline outputs verifiable PubMed IDs, enabling researchers to backtrack to the source text. In contrast, the Baseline LLM frequently generated plausible but non-existent citations or failed to provide specific literature evidence, rendering its outputs unsuitable for regulatory audit.

\textbf{Justification for Lower Recall.} 
The reader will note that our Recall@10 is slightly lower than the baseline (0.113 vs 0.133). This is a deliberate design choice inherent to the deterministic architecture. The graph constraints ($D \to T \to P$) act as a ``high-pass filter'' for evidence: if a drug-disease link lacks a documented protein target in ChEMBL or OpenTargets, our system will silently reject it, even if it is mentioned in literature. Consequently, our system produces shorter, higher-confidence lists, naturally reducing total recall compared to GPT-4o's broad, probabilistic retrieval.

\textbf{Superiority in Safety-Critical Contexts.}
In drug discovery and pharmacovigilance, the cost of errors is asymmetric. A False Negative (missing a link) may delay discovery, but a False Positive (hallucinating a mechanism) can lead to wasted clinical trials, financial loss, or dangerous off-label usage. GPT-4o's 76.6\% hallucination rate implies that a significant portion of its generated claims lack evidence. By contrast, our method enforces strict structural rejection of unsupported mechanistic paths, substantially reducing high-confidence false positives and making it better suited for regulatory contexts where auditability and provenance are non-negotiable.

\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case-studies}
We analyze two specific cases to demonstrate mechanistic traceability (supporting PMIDs available in supplementary materials):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sorafenib (CHEMBL1336):} Our graph reconstructs the off-target toxicity pathway: Sorafenib~$\to$~\textit{VEGFR2 (KDR)}~inhibition~$\to$~\textbf{Hypertension} (EFO:0000537). While Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor primarily used for renal cell carcinoma, the system retrieved specific abstracts linking KDR inhibition to vascular constriction (e.g., PMID:17909006, PMID:19188387), explaining the hypertensive phenotype often missed by broad keyword searches.
    \item \textbf{Clozapine (CHEMBL42):} The system identified the metabolic adverse effect path: Clozapine~$\to$~\textit{HTR2C} (5-HT2C receptor)~antagonism~$\to$~\textbf{Weight Gain/Obesity} (EFO:0001073). Unlike statistical baselines that merely correlate drug and effect, our pipeline provided a chain of evidence verifying that blockade of serotonin receptors is the mechanistic driver for metabolic syndrome (e.g., PMID:16402131, PMID:18725236).
    \item \textbf{Negative Example---Acetaminophen \& Schizophrenia:} When queried for Acetaminophen~$\to$~Schizophrenia, the system correctly returned ``no traceable association'' because no intermediate target connects the two with sufficient evidence, demonstrating appropriate constraint behavior.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work}
We presented a deterministic Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) architecture that inverts the standard RAG paradigm: structural traceability precedes and constrains generation, rather than generation guiding retrieval. By anchoring every emitted association to an explicit Drug~($D$) to Target~($T$) to Phenotype~($P$) path constructed from curated databases (ChEMBL, OpenTargets) and validated via literature co-occurrence (PubMed), our pipeline ensures that predictions are audit-ready and mechanistically grounded. The Large Language Model (LLM) operates strictly as a constrained reader, summarizing pre-retrieved evidence without the discretion to fabricate links, speculate beyond data, or hallucinate citations.

Our evaluation against the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) demonstrates the feasibility of enforcing deterministic constraints without sacrificing coverage: the system successfully reconstructs known drug--disease associations with explicit protein-mediated paths (e.g., Sorafenib to VEGFR2 to Hypertension) and correctly rejects spurious queries (e.g., Acetaminophen to Schizophrenia) when no valid path exists. This design has implications beyond drug discovery: it provides a blueprint for safety-critical biomedical AI where \emph{prediction validity is tied to evidence provenance}, enabling regulatory compliance, post-hoc auditing, and iterative refinement as knowledge bases evolve.

\paragraph{Auditable AI and Faithfulness.}
We distinguish \emph{traceability} (structural graph existence) from \emph{faithfulness} (textual accuracy). While the graph ensures valid pathways, the LLM summarization retains residual risk of misinterpretation. By treating outputs as \emph{structured arguments} with explicit premises and evidence, we enable diagnostics for failure modes—such as missing edges or low confidence—which is essential for trust in clinical settings.

\paragraph{Limitations and Future Work.}
Our approach relies on upstream data, inheriting biases toward well-studied targets (e.g., kinases) and potential lags in curation. The strict single-hop path requirement ($D\to T\to P$) limits the detection of complex, multi-hop pathway mechanisms. Future extensions will address this by expanding to multi-hop paths ($D\to T_1\to T_2\to P$), incorporating adverse event databases (FAERS, SIDER), and developing confidence-calibrated outputs to distinguish tentative from robust associations.

\paragraph{Data and Code Availability.}
The 50-drug evaluation set and CTD ground-truth mappings are derived from publicly available databases (ChEMBL, OpenTargets, CTD). API access dates and cached responses for reproducibility will be provided in supplementary materials. Code will be made available upon publication.
